# Short.ly url shortener

## Yuhu Project

### Part 1 (Backend).

Add API endpoints that allow a user to submit a URL and access a shortened version.

#### Considerations:

- What pieces of data do we care about storing? What if we wanted statistics?
- Should the data be mutable?
- How long should the shortened part of the URL be? Could it be dynamically sized?

### Part 2 (Front end) .

Create a front end in React that allows for submitting a URL and displaying the shortened version.

#### Considerations:

- What is important to validate?
- How should the network requests be sent?
- How would we view statistics about a URL?

### Part 3 (Optional) .

This section can be considered a nice-to-have. Add a scoreboard to the landing page displaying the top 5 URLs.

#### Considerations:

- You can choose to rank based on number of times requested vs number of times submitted
