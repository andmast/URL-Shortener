# Short.ly url shortener

## Yuhu Project

### Part 1 (Backend).

Add API endpoints that allow a user to submit a URL and access a shortened version.
Considerations:
• What pieces of data do we care about storing? What if we wanted statistics?
• Should the data be mutable?
• How long should the shortened part of the URL be? Could it be dynamically
sized?

### Part 2 (Front end) .

Create a front end in React that allows for submitting a URL and displaying the
shortened version.
Considerations:
• What is important to validate?
• How should the network requests be sent?
• How would we view statistics about a URL?

### Part 3 (Optional) .

This section can be considered a nice-to-have. Add a scoreboard to the landing page
displaying the top 5 URLs.
Considerations:
• You can choose to rank based on number of times requested vs number of
times submitted

### Part 4 (Questions) .

This part of the project doesn't require you to develop any features but to think about
how certain aspects of the product could be extended. There is no required
documentation for this, the purpose is to allow for us to discuss how additional
functionality could be added together.
• We didn't require authentication for the application but if we wanted to develop
multiple API usage tiers, what are our options? How would this affect the front end?
• If this was an open service how could it be monetized? What features would
need to be added?
